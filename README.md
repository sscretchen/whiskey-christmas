# Whiskey Christmas

My First Web Dev Project - A blog that was built with a dynamic UI and simple user experience in mind. Users can post dynamic entries using the tinyMCE field and comment on other posts. User Authentication, Search feature, categories, and tags are but a few of the features found in this project.
